# Paper abstract / Intro:

Accurate protein binding site annotations are vital for a profound understanding of biological processes and
protein interactions. Due to less supporting information a large number of proteins remain uncharacterised.
For large sets of uncharacterised proteins, only amino acid information is available. In this paper, we proposed
BSite-pro – a traditional approach – which utilizes only the protein sequences to predict its associated binding
site. The prediction process requires hand-crafted features of the protein sequences. Our results indicate
significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy and recall when compared to other sequence-based
methods. BSite-pro achieves an overall validation accuracy of 85.06% and recall of 82.17%. Finally, we
discuss that using the same feature extraction methods and model, we successfully solved two different types
of problem i.e. protein active and conserved sites prediction.
